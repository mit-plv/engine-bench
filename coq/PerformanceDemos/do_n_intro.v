(** * Performance Criterion: Adding a new binder underneath n binders should be OÌƒ(1) *)

(** We can establish this criterion in two ways: using the proof
    engine to add a new binder via [intro], or looking at the marginal
    increase of adding another binder to a term and re-type-checking
    it. *)

(** Note that in Coq, this is severely complicated by the overhead of
    fresh name generation. *)

(** See also COQBUG(https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/8244) *)

(** TODO: Maybe we should organize files by the performance criterion
     and not the tested tactic? *)
