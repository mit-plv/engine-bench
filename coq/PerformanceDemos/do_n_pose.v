(** * Performance Criterion: Adding a new let binder underneath n lets should be OÌƒ(1) *)

(** We can establish this criterion in two ways: using the proof
    engine to add a new let binder, or looking at the marginal
    increase of adding another let binder to a term and
    re-type-checking it. *)

(** Note that in Coq, this is severely complicated by the overhead of
    fresh name generation. *)
