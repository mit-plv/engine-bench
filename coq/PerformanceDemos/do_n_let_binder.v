(** * Performance Criterion: Adding a new let binder underneath n lets should be OÌƒ(1) *)

(** We can establish this criterion in three ways: using the proof
    engine to add a new let binder either (a) via [pose] or (b) via
    [intro], or (c) looking at the marginal increase of adding another
    let binder to a term and re-type-checking it. *)

(** Note that in Coq, this is severely complicated by the overhead of
    fresh name generation. *)
